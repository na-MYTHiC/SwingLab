/**
 * The canonical shot schema.
 *
 * Every ingest adapter — TrackMan CSV today, the TrackMan partner API or a
 * Foresight/Uneekor/SkyTrak export later — converts into exactly this shape.
 * Nothing downstream of ingest is allowed to know which launch monitor the
 * data came from. That rule is what keeps the analysis engine portable.
 *
 * CANONICAL UNITS. Adapters must convert; the engine never guesses.
 *
 *   speeds            mph
 *   angles            degrees
 *   spin rate         rpm
 *   flight distances  yards   (carry, total, side, sideTotal, curve)
 *   apex height       feet
 *   low point         inches
 *   impact position   mm      (offset, height — signed, see below)
 *   time              seconds
 *
 * Apex and low point deliberately break the "one linear unit" rule because
 * feet and inches are the units golfers and coaches actually speak in for
 * those two numbers. Apex in yards and low point in yards both read as
 * nonsense on a report, and a unit nobody sanity-checks is a unit that hides
 * bugs.
 *
 * SIGN CONVENTIONS (right-handed golfer, looking down the target line).
 * A left-handed golfer's data is mirrored at ingest so that every sign below
 * means the same thing for every player; see `handedness` on ShotSession.
 *
 *   clubPath          + = in-to-out (rightward),  - = out-to-in
 *   faceAngle         + = open (right of target), - = closed
 *   faceToPath        + = face open to path  -> fade/slice shape
 *                     - = face closed to path -> draw/hook shape
 *   launchDirection   + = starts right of target
 *   spinAxis          + = tilted right -> ball curves right
 *   side / curve      + = right of target
 *   attackAngle       + = hitting up on the ball, - = hitting down
 *   swingDirection    + = rightward (in-to-out plane)
 *   impactOffset      + = toward the toe, - = toward the heel
 *   impactHeight      + = above centre face, - = below
 *   lowPointDistance  + = low point is AFTER the ball (ball-first, correct
 *                         for irons off the deck), - = before the ball (fat)
