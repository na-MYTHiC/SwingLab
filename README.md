# SwingLab

An AI golf coach built around TrackMan simulator data. Import a session, get a
ranked list of what is actually wrong and a practice plan that addresses it.

Runs entirely on your own device. No account, no server, no subscription, no
API bills — see [Why it is free](#why-it-is-free).

## Status

| Piece | State |
| --- | --- |
| `packages/core` — schema, ingest, diagnosis, impact, practice | **Built and tested**, 106 tests passing |
| `apps/app` — React PWA (browser, mobile, installable) | **Built and verified** in a headless browser |
| `apps/desktop` — Tauri shell + folder watcher | **Scaffolded, not compiled** — needs platform webview dev packages |

The app shows its version and build stamp in the header and footer (`v1.0.0 ·
<commit> · built <date>`), injected at build time rather than typed in, and
the service worker is keyed to that version so a deploy cannot leave you
looking at a cached older build.

## What it does

**Reads every kind of TrackMan session.** Range, Target Practice, Test Center,
Combine, Performance Center, the games, course play and putting. The activity
is detected at ingest, because the same numbers mean different things in
different modes — carry spread across a Combine's ten targets is the protocol,
not a fault.

**Ranks findings by what fixing them is worth,** not by how bad the number
looks. Each finding carries an estimated cost in shots per round *and* in
points on a scored test, weighted by how fast the fix pays off. Estimates are
labelled as estimates.

**Follows the causal chain.** A wandering strike lowers smash factor, widens
carry and tilts spin axis — four findings, one fault. Root causes are credited
with what they unlock, symptoms are nested underneath them, and practice is
built from root causes only, so a session never works the same fault three
times under three names. Strike still precedes direction on the same club as a
hard constraint.

**Prescribes practice in the actual modes.** Every block names the TrackMan
mode, where to find it, the setup steps, and what a good result looks like —
with target distances taken from your own carries.

## Getting your data out of TrackMan

This was the first question worth answering, because it determines what the
product can be. The findings, so the next person does not have to redo them:

| Path | Automatable? | Reality |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Partner APIs** — Cloud GraphQL (`api.golf.trackman.com/graphql`), Range REST API, TM4 device WebSocket, Booking & Payments webhooks | Fully | Real and documented, but behind a commercial agreement. The Range API targets range *operators*, not simulator bays. Worth applying for; not worth depending on. |
| **TPS export** — Table View → File Options → *TrackMan CSV* / *TrackMan Stroke File* | Near-automatic | Works today, needs nobody's permission, and it is the player's own data. 40+ columns. **This is what SwingLab is built on.** |
| **TrackMan Golf app / mytrackman.com** — every sim and range shot auto-syncs, with videos and course scorecards | No | The data is all there, but TrackMan's software terms prohibit "page-scrape, robot, spider or other automatic devices" against it. Scripted login is both a terms violation and permanently fragile. |
| **Screenshots / PDF session reports** | Vision extraction | The fallback for rented bays and other people's facilities. Planned, not built. |

**The design consequence:** the desktop shell watches your TPS export folder,
so exporting once at the end of a session is the entire workflow. That is as
close to automatic as anyone can legitimately get today. If TrackMan ever
grants API access it becomes one more entry in
`packages/core/src/ingest/registry.ts`, and nothing else in the codebase
changes.

## Why it is free

Every design decision that could have introduced a cost was routed around:

- **No LLM API.** Diagnosis is a deterministic rule engine over measured
  numbers, and the drills are a curated static library. This is not a
  compromise — see [Why the maths is not done by a model](#why-the-maths-is-not-done-by-a-model).
- **No backend and no database.** Sessions live in `localStorage` on the
  device. Nothing is uploaded, so there is nothing to host.
- **No app store.** Mobile is a PWA — installable from the browser, no
  developer-program fee. The desktop shell builds and runs locally for free;
  only *distributing signed binaries* costs money, and that is optional.
- **No paid tooling.** TypeScript, Vite, React, Vitest, Tauri — all free.

The one genuine cost, if you ever want it, is App Store distribution
(Apple $99/yr, Google $25 once). Nothing in the current design requires it.

## Why the maths is not done by a model

Ball flight is physics with well-understood relationships: face-to-path
governs curvature, spin loft governs spin, low point governs strike quality.
Code applies those correctly every time. A language model asked to do the same
arithmetic is fluent and occasionally wrong — the worst possible combination
in a tool someone uses to change their swing.

So every finding in `packages/core/src/diagnose/` is produced by a rule with
explicit thresholds and stated evidence. If a narration layer is added later
(a local Ollama model, or your own free API key), it will receive findings as
input and will not be permitted to invent new ones.

The same principle drives three behaviours worth knowing about:

- **It stays quiet when the data cannot support a claim.** Fewer than seven
  shots with a club is flagged low-confidence and minor findings are hidden.
- **It does not diagnose fields the hardware never measured.** TrackMan iO
  Home reports ball data plus a few club numbers; TM4 reports everything.
  Rules skip themselves rather than inventing inputs.
- **It will not invent gaps across clubs you did not hit.** A session of
  driver, 5-iron, 7-iron and wedge does not have a "61-yard hole" in the bag —
  it has an unhit 3-wood. Only genuinely adjacent clubs produce a gapping
  finding.

## Architecture

```
ingest adapters      TrackMan CSV │ stroke file │ (screenshot) │ (partner API)
        ↓
canonical shot schema        packages/core/src/schema.ts
        ↓
outlier + robust stats       medians and MAD, never means
        ↓
deterministic rule engine    packages/core/src/diagnose/
        ↓
findings + practice plan
        ↓
apps/app (PWA)  ·  apps/desktop (Tauri shell + folder watcher)
```

`packages/core` is pure TypeScript with no network, filesystem or platform
APIs, so the identical engine runs in the browser, in the desktop window and
in the test suite.

### Layout

```
packages/core/src/
├── schema.ts              Canonical Shot / ShotSession + units + sign conventions
├── units.ts               Unit parsing and conversion (metric exports, European decimals)
├── clubs.ts               Club label normalisation and bag ordering
├── ingest/                One adapter per launch monitor + a registry
├── stats/                 Robust summaries, mishit detection, per-club profiles
├── benchmarks/            Tour reference tables and sane windows
└── diagnose/              The rules, the drill library, and the orchestrator

apps/app/                  React PWA — drop a CSV, read the report
apps/desktop/              Tauri shell — watches the TPS export folder
fixtures/                  Sample TrackMan exports (imperial and metric)
```

## Version and updates

The header chip shows the version; the footer shows `v<version> · <commit> ·
built <date>`. Both are injected by Vite from `apps/app/package.json` at build
time rather than typed into the markup, so they cannot drift from the code.

The service worker is registered with the version in its URL and keys its
cache to it, so a release changes the worker's URL, the browser installs it,
and the page reloads once the new worker takes over. Navigations are
network-first; only content-hashed assets are served cache-first. Serving the
HTML entry point from cache is exactly how a PWA pins itself to an old build,
which is the failure the version display exists to make visible.

To cut a release, bump the version in `apps/app/package.json` and push.

## Sample data

`samples/` holds generated TrackMan exports so the app can be exercised
without owning a launch monitor. Each one deliberately triggers a different
path:

| File | What it exercises |
| --- | --- |
| `1-range-slicer.csv` | Range session: open face to path, toe strike, driver hit downward |
| `2-combine.csv` | Combine: consistently short of every flag, weakest at 160 yards |
| `3-test-center-wedges.csv` | Test Center: a wedge ladder with loose distance control |
| `4-clean-session.csv` | Nothing much wrong — proves the app stays quiet instead of inventing a fault |
| `5-` to `8-trend-week*.csv` | Four weekly sessions with a real improvement, for the Trends view |

Import all four `trend-week` files to see Trends; it needs at least three
sessions with the same club before it will say anything.

Regenerate with `node tools/make-samples.mjs`. The generator is deterministic
and keeps the physics self-consistent — face to path really is face minus
path, smash really is ball speed over club speed — because a fixture with
impossible numbers in it will eventually be used to "prove" a rule works when
it does not.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm test          # 63 tests in packages/core
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build         # core, then the web app
pnpm dev           # web app at http://localhost:5173
```

Drop `fixtures/trackman-session-imperial.csv` on the running app to see a
full report without owning a TrackMan.

## Roadmap

Ordered by value, not by ease:

1. **Longitudinal trends** — the same findings across sessions, so the app can
   say "your low point moved 2 inches back over three weeks". The single
   biggest thing the current version lacks.
2. **Screenshot ingest** — vision extraction from a photo of the TPS screen,
   for rented bays.
3. **Strokes gained for simulator rounds** — needs lie and distance per shot,
   which the shot CSV does not carry. Requires course-round parsing or a
   lightweight round-entry mode.
4. **More launch monitors** — Foresight, Uneekor, SkyTrak, Garmin. One adapter
   each, no other changes.
5. **Optional narration** — local Ollama or a user-supplied free API key,
   strictly on top of computed findings.
6. **Video** — phone capture plus on-device pose estimation, correlated
   against the numbers.

## Prior art

SimSights Golf, SHOTMETRICS AI and ShotIQ all do CSV-to-AI-analysis already,
and several vendors demoed in-simulator AI coaching at the 2026 PGA Show. The
differentiation here has to be depth on TrackMan specifically, honesty about
what the data can and cannot support, and the longitudinal coaching
relationship — not the fact that it parses a CSV.
